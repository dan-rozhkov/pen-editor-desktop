# CLAUDE.md — pen-editor-desktop

Thin Electron shell for pen-editor. The editor itself is NOT here — each tab
is a `WebContentsView` loading the deployed frontend
(`https://pen-editor.onrender.com/app`, override with `PEN_DESKTOP_URL`;
`npm run dev` points it at a local Vite dev server on :5173). The frontend
serves its showcase gallery at `/` and the editor at `/app`, so both the
default URL and any override must include the `/app` path — an override is
used verbatim. The AI backend stays remote. Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-electron-shell-design.md`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build     # tsc + copy static files → dist/
npm start         # build + launch Electron
npm run dev       # same, against http://localhost:5173
npm test          # Vitest unit tests (test/)
npm run test:e2e  # build + Playwright _electron smoke (stub HTTP server, no network)
npm run lint      # tsc --noEmit
npm run dist      # electron-builder → release/ (mac dmg+zip, unsigned)
```

## Architecture

`src/main/window.ts` wires one `BaseWindow`: a tab-bar `WebContentsView`
(local HTML, `src/tabbar/`) on top and one `WebContentsView` per tab below.
All logic lives in pure, unit-tested modules — `tabManager.ts` (tab
lifecycle; Electron views injected as `TabViewHandle`), `menu.ts` (template),
`navigation.ts` (origin clamp → `shell.openExternal`, offline fallback),
`config.ts` (URL resolution). Keep `window.ts` and `index.ts` free of
decisions; put logic in the pure modules and test it.

All editor views run `contextIsolation: true, sandbox: true, nodeIntegration:
false`; the only bridge is `src/preload/tab.ts`. The whole package compiles
as CommonJS (sandboxed preloads can't be ESM) — no `.js` import-extension
rule here. `src/tabbar/renderer.ts` must compile to a plain script (no
`exports`/`require` in the output — it runs in a CSP'd `<script src>`).

## Cross-repo contract (menu command ids)

Native menu items send pen-editor **command-palette ids** over IPC
`menu:command`; the editor's `src/lib/desktopBridge.ts` dispatches them via
`getCommands()`. Currently used: `file-open`, `file-export-pen`,
`file-export-json`, `file-export-tokens`, `file-import-tokens`. Adding a
menu item = pick an existing `PaletteCommand.id` in
`pen-editor/src/lib/commands/` (or add one there first). Both CLAUDE.md
files list this id set — keep them in sync.

The contract is enforced from the **pen-editor** side:
`pen-editor/src/lib/__tests__/desktopMenuContract.test.ts` imports this repo's
`src/main/menu.ts` (loadable without `npm ci` — the electron import is
type-only), clicks every item with recording actions, and asserts the
forwarded ids both match its pinned list and resolve through `getCommands()`.
pen-editor's `contract` CI job checks out this repo's `main` at run time, so a
menu id typed only here is caught there, not in this repo — this repo has no
CI of its own. Adding or renaming a forwarded id means touching four places:
`menu.ts`, that test's pinned list, and both CLAUDE.md files.

## IPC channels

- `menu:command` main→tab (commandId string)
- `editor:document-title` tab→main (document display name, normalized to `Untitled`)
- `editor:theme` tab→main (`light` | `dark`, observed from the editor's root class)
- `tabbar:state` main→tabbar (`TabsSnapshot`, now including `mcpStatus`), re-sent on tabbar `did-finish-load`
- `tabbar:theme` main→tabbar (`light` | `dark`, active editor theme or system fallback)
- `tabbar:new` / `tabbar:activate` / `tabbar:close` tabbar→main (sender-checked)
- `mcp:register` tab→main (`{protocol, tools} | null`; `null` unregisters) — desktop MCP bridge, see below
- `mcp:call` main→tab only (`{callId, tool, args}`)
- `mcp:result` tab→main (`{callId, type: "tool_result" | "tool_error", result?, error?}`)

Both ends of every channel live in this repo — the editor only ever touches
the preload API, never a channel name. `test/ipcContract.test.ts` scans `src/`
for the literals and pins this table: each channel must be sent and received in
its declared direction and nowhere else, the set must match exactly (a new
channel fails until it is listed here too), and every `ipcMain.on` must have a
matching `removeListener` — that last one is the window close/reopen listener
leak `window.ts` guards against. Renaming a channel on one side only is
otherwise silent: Electron matches these strings at runtime and just stops
delivering.

## Desktop MCP bridge

`src/main/mcp/` implements a loopback MCP endpoint (`httpServer.ts` +
`jsonRpc.ts`) that routes `tools/call` into whichever editor tab is active
(`dispatcher.ts`) via `preload/tab.ts`'s `registerMcpBridge` and the three
`mcp:*` channels above, and publishes `~/.pen-editor/mcp.json` for
`pen-editor-plugin` to discover (`handshake.ts`). `mcp/service.ts` owns all
of this — the HTTP server, the token, handshake-ownership state, and the
tab registry — as a single instance created once in `index.ts` and passed
into every `createMainWindow` call. This is deliberate: on macOS closing the
last window does not quit the app (`index.ts` reopens one on `activate`), so
anything window-scoped would die and never come back — the same shape as
the `Menu.setApplicationMenu` wart noted above. `window.ts` only *reports*
tab create/destroy/active into the service; it never owns MCP state itself.

Identity on `mcp:register`/`mcp:result` comes from `event.sender.id` checked
against tabs the service itself created via `registerTab()` — the same
pattern as `window.ts`'s `fromOurTabbar` check — so a page cannot register
or answer on behalf of another tab. `service.ts` is deliberately
Electron-free (no `import ... from "electron"`) so it stays unit-testable
under plain Node/vitest, where requiring the `electron` package returns a
path string rather than the API; `window.ts`/`index.ts` adapt real
`ipcMain`/`webContents` objects to its small injected interfaces
(`TabHandle`, `IpcListenerGateway`).

Only the MCP status string (`"listening" | "not-published" | "off" | "error"`)
ever crosses into anything rendered — never the token or the port number. The
tab strip's indicator and the File menu's "MCP: …"/"Use this app for MCP"
items (see `menu.ts`) are the only diagnostics available, since a packaged app
has no terminal.
