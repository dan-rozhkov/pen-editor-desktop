 * Wave 3 reliability, item 1: a shadow-DOM-piercing `querySelectorAll`.

 * closed) — a growing share of real sites (design-system web components,
 * `<script type="module">` custom elements) put their interactive content
 * behind one, and every element-resolution path in this file
 * (`findByText`, `findBySnapshot`, `SNAPSHOT_JS`'s candidate walk,
 * `READ_JS`'s text/heading/link collection, `FIND_IMAGES_JS`'s image scan)
 * used to simply never see it. `deepQueryAll(root, selector)` walks `root`,
 * collects `root.querySelectorAll(selector)`, then recurses into every
 * descendant's `.shadowRoot` — only ever `open` roots are reachable this
 * way at all (a `closed` root's `shadowRoot` property is `null` from
 * outside, so this is naturally scoped to "open" without any extra check).
 * A closed shadow root is opaque to `document.elementFromPoint` too, so
 * `CLICK_RESOLVE_JS`'s hit-test needs no equivalent change — it already
 * pierces every open shadow root Chromium's own implementation does.
 *
 * Bounded so a huge page (or one with many/deep nested shadow trees) stays
 * fast: `PEN_DEEP_QUERY_MAX_NODES` (5000) caps the total number of elements
 * visited across the whole walk, `PEN_DEEP_QUERY_MAX_DEPTH` (30) caps
 * shadow-root nesting depth (not plain DOM depth, which querySelectorAll
 * already handles natively within one root). Once either bound is hit the
 * walk simply stops descending further — a partial result (missing only
 * what's past the cap) rather than an error, matching this file's existing
 * "degrade, don't throw" posture for every other page script.

 * descriptor as a proxy when only density descriptors are present) is
 * preferred over `currentSrc`/`src`, which the page may only be rendering

 * the existing rendered `width`/`height` (which still means rendered size —
 * the e2e suite pins that) so a consumer can tell a small asset from a
 * small *rendering* of a large one. Still no per-host URL rewriting — that
 * is the part that rots.
 *
 * Review finding 1 (HIGH): the original `srcset.split(",")` broke on the
 * comma-bearing URLs real CDNs routinely serve (Cloudinary/imgix transforms
 * like `https://cdn/x/w_800,h_600/a.jpg 800w`) — the URL itself split into
 * two pieces, the descriptor-less fragment ("…w_800") was skipped, and the
 * remainder ("h_600/a.jpg 800w") won on score and got returned as a
 * relative URL fragment, silently 404ing every image `browse_find_images`
 * returned on such a host — worse than the bug this fix originally set out
 * to solve. Splitting on `,\\s+` (comma *followed by whitespace*, which is
 * how the srcset grammar actually separates candidates — a raw comma
 * embedded in a URL is essentially never followed by whitespace) fixes the
 * real-world case; `pickLargestSrcsetCandidate` additionally verifies the
 * winning candidate resolves as a URL at all before returning it, falling
 * back to `currentSrc || src` rather than ever handing back something that
 * isn't a URL.
 *
 * Review finding 5: `naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight` used to always come from
 * the `<img>` element's *loaded* resource, even once this fix started
 * preferring a *different*, larger URL from `srcset` that the browser may
 * never have fetched — reporting a real thumbnail's tiny naturalWidth next
 * to a much larger returned URL defeats the documented "tell a small asset
 * from a small rendering" use of these fields. Whenever the returned URL
 * came from a `w`-descriptor `srcset` candidate at all, the descriptor's own
 * declared width is reported instead of `img.naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight` —
 * *even when that candidate happens to be the one the browser actually
 * fetched*: per the HTML spec, a `w`-descriptor selection makes the browser
 * report a *density-corrected* `naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight` (the resource's
 * real pixel size divided by an implied pixel density computed from the
 * descriptor and the "sizes"-resolved target width, which defaults to the
 * viewport width) rather than the resource's true pixel dimensions — so
 * trusting `img.naturalWidth` even in the "matches what's loaded" case
 * quietly reports a viewport-width-dependent number instead of the image's
 * real size. Height is estimated from the loaded image's own aspect ratio
 * (density correction scales both dimensions by the same factor, so the
 * *ratio* stays meaningful even though the absolute numbers don't) or the
 * rendered box's, if even that isn't known. With no `srcset` involved at
 * all, `img.naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight` are reported as-is (no density
 * correction applies without `srcset`). With no declared width to fall back
 * on (an `x`-density-only srcset), natural size is omitted entirely rather
 * than reporting a number that describes the wrong image.

 * own host; a closed shadow root is opaque to this check the same way it is
 * to `elementFromPoint` itself, and simply hit-tests against the host.
 * `hitOk` is also false outright when the element has zero rendered size or
 * its centre point falls outside the current viewport — a trusted mouse
 * event at an off-screen or invisible point is not meaningfully "a click on
 * this element" even if some other element happens to occupy that point.
 *
 * Also reports `editable` (code review finding 4) — a read-only tag/
 * `isContentEditable` check, the same one `SELECT_ALL_CONTENT_JS` uses —
 * so `controller.ts`'s `dispatchType` can check it BEFORE sending any

 *
 * Review findings 2/3/4 reshaped this considerably from the original
 * addendum:
 *
 * - It now takes `args.phase` ("before" | "after") — no longer argument-free
 *   — because it needs to coordinate element-identity markers across the two
 *   calls (see below), which a stateless single-shot script can't do.
 * - `scrollY` and a `focusedValueLength` (the currently-focused input's
 *   value length, never its content) join the signature (finding 3): the
 *   old signature had nothing that moved for a successful scroll or a

 * - `mainImageSrc` is now identity-guarded (finding 4's "guard against the

 *   `phase: "before"`, the element currently largest-by-visible-area is
 *   found and stamped `data-pen-sig-mainimg`; on `phase: "after"`, the
 *   *same* stamped element (if it still exists) is re-read, rather than
 *   recomputing "largest visible img" from scratch, which could now pick a
 *   newly-loaded ad instead of the element that actually changed.
 * - On `phase: "after"`, if the acting script (CLICK_JS/TYPE_JS/PERFORM_JS)
 *   stamped an element `data-pen-sig-target`, its scoped signature is
 *   re-computed and returned as `scopedAfter` (see SCOPED_SIGNATURE_JS).
 * - `phase: "before"` also sweeps away any `data-pen-sig-mainimg` /
 *   `data-pen-sig-target` markers left over from a *previous* action, so
 *   each action's identity tracking starts clean.
 *
 * `nodeCount`/`textLength`/`textHash` (the whole-document numbers) are
 * still computed and returned — controller.ts still reports them in
 * `changes` as useful context — but per finding 4 they no longer gate
 * `changed` on their own; see diffSignatures's doc comment.

/**
 * A readable digest of the current page (jev-loop design doc "Addendum 2,
 * 2026-09-19" §2, `browse_read`): visible text with script/style/noscript/
 * nav chrome stripped and whitespace collapsed, h1-h3 headings in document
 * order, and deduped http(s) links — each capped per the design doc so the
 * payload is bounded by construction, not by trusting the caller.
 * `args.selector`, when given, narrows the whole read to one subtree; when
 * it matches nothing this returns `{ error }` rather than silently reading
 * the whole page.
 *
 * Review finding 9: with a `selector`, `text` already included the root
 * element itself (collectText walks the root's own child nodes), but
 * `headings`/`links` used `root.querySelectorAll(...)`, which only matches
 * *descendants* — so `read({ selector: "h1" })` returned that heading's own
 * text in `text` but an empty `headings` array. `queryIncludingSelf` below
 * makes the two consistent: the root itself is checked against the selector
 * too, not just its descendants.
 *
 * Review finding 8: `truncated` used to reflect only the text cap — the
 * 40-heading and 60-link caps were applied silently, so a page with (say)
 * 500 links reported 60 of them with `truncated: false`, and a consumer had
 * no way to know anything was cut. `headingsTruncated`/`linksTruncated` now
 * report each collection's own truncation alongside the existing
 * (text-only) `truncated` field.

/**
 * Drives the visible, human-like cursor overlay for the built-in browser tab
 * (design: a human-watched agent that clicks/types instantly and invisibly
 * looks broken even when it's working correctly). Unlike every other script
 * in this file, its value is a **Promise** — Electron's `executeJavaScript`
 * awaits whatever the injected expression evaluates to, and the whole point
 * here is an animation that spans several `requestAnimationFrame` ticks, not
 * a synchronous computation.
 *
 * `controller.ts`'s `moveCursor` runs this **before** the before-action
 * `captureSignature` call in every call site that acts on the page (click,
 * type, scroll, perform's CLICK/TYPE_TEXT/SELECT/SCROLL_UP/SCROLL_DOWN) —
 * deliberately, not incidentally: the overlay's own DOM insertion and the
 * `scrollIntoView` this script performs while locating the target are both
 * observable page mutations, and "Addendum 2"'s evidence-of-effect feature
 * (SIGNATURE_JS, `diffSignatures`) exists specifically to tell the agent
 * whether *its* action changed the page. Running the cursor between the two
 * signature captures would fold the cursor's own DOM/scroll footprint into
 * that diff and manufacture false "changed: true" evidence for actions that
 * didn't actually do anything. Running it before "before" keeps it invisible
 * to that mechanism.
 *
 * `pointer-events:none` on the overlay root — and every element inside it —
 * is a hard invariant, not a style choice: this overlay sits on top of the
 * real page content at `z-index:2147483647`, and if it ever became
 * click-through-blocking it would silently break every subsequent
 * click/type this bridge performs (its own and the user's, since a browser
 * tab has no preload to route around it).
 *
 * Never throws and always settles quickly: every code path is wrapped so a
 * failure resolves `{ error }` rather than rejecting, and a `finish()` guard
 * plus a hard backstop timer (~1.15s, comfortably under this repo's other
 * short page-script budgets) mean the promise always settles even if
 * `requestAnimationFrame` never fires again — which upstream findings in
 * this same repo (see get_screenshot's rAF-in-a-background-tab gotcha) show
 * does happen. The backstop is disarmed *only* inside `finish()` itself,
 * never by a caller ahead of time — including on the final "arrived, ripple
 * playing" leg, whose own settle is an unguarded `setTimeout` that a
 * throttled/hidden renderer can stretch past 1s — so the backstop stays live
 * and able to win that race for every settle path, not just the early-return
 * ones. `moveCursor` on the controller side wraps this in its own,
 * slightly longer timeout and swallows every failure besides — the cursor
 * must never turn a working browser command into an error or a timeout.
