   * matters beyond micro-optimization: several existing behaviors (e.g.
   * `withCommandTimeout` capturing `pageHandles`/`currentPage()` "before
   * `fn()` runs") were written, and tested, assuming a command begins
   * executing in the same synchronous tick it's called in, up to its own
   * first `await`. Always deferring the start by one `Promise.then()` hop
